    compute the possible maximal (N)umber of matching points from one model.
    In practical the function should be applied on holeCountLists of two models. And then choose the minimal one.
    Arguments:
        inputList {list} -- each element reprecent the number of connections to a point.
                            The direction of connections is not considered.
                            Ex, PointA->point B and from point B-> pointA are consider as the same connection.
                            The connection number of point A is 1. Also connection number of point B is 1.

    Returns:
        maxPossibleN {int} -- N means the number of matching points
